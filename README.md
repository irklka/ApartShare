The idea behind the proposed web application is to help people to
find a place to stay for a while during traveling. The app will be
used to find a host for a traveler, and to connect them. 
Hosts could be travelers and vice versa. The main value of the app is sharing and caring, 
so no payments will be involved.

<p>Application has two parts</p>

<ul>
  <li>.Net6 Core web Api - backend</li>
  <li> React.js - frontend</li>
</ul>
