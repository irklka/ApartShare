# ApartShare

The idea behind the proposed web application is to help people to
find a place to stay for a while during traveling. The app will be
used to find a host for a traveler, and to connect them. 
Hosts could be travelers and vice versa. The main value of the app is sharing and caring, 
so no payments will be involved.

Application has two parts .Net6 web Api in the backend and React.js in Frontend



Frontend was done by https://github.com/Vagabond169 Vagabond
I worked on backend.
